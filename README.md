# fsai #

The FSAI is a analytical tool for file system. Main idea is to check files allocation in specified
or current directory and try propose new organization for them based on types and meta data. 
So many files can have different aspects and categories. 

For example image files can have different formats and types, also they can contains images for 
different people or places but they can be organized by creation data, or photo shot data, 
or persons who imaging at photo, or events, or cites, or places. 
The same file can have many aspects and can have many links in different directies which are reflect 
these aspects. Human minds can sort any files but when we have a thousands of 
files there is time waste task is not resolvable. Main idea to delegate to computer this "easy" task =).

Right now this project in Startup state... When it will be help full I'll remove this line ;)
